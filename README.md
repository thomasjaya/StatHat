# Description
StatHat is a 1.8.9 forge mod for displaying hypixel duels stats above a player's head.

# Features
- The mod only renders when a player’s name is not obfuscated (random characters before a game starts)
- It doesn’t render in any lobby or game other than duels, however will render always in other servers.

note - all stats come from slothpixel not directly from the hypixel API so any downtime of the mod is likely linked to that. If any sort of downtime persists I will switch to the hypixel API which has the downside of requiring an api key.

# Commands

- /stathat help - displays a list of commands​
