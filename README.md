# Description
StatHat is a 1.8.9 forge mod for displaying hypixel duels stats above a player's head.

# Features
- Displays a player's win/loss and title above their head
- Choose which duels gamemode you wish to display stats for
- Automatic setting which displays stats of current game playing
- Only renders when a player’s name is not obfuscated (random characters before a game starts) to prevent queue dodging.
- Doesn't render in any lobby or game other than duels, however will render always in other servers, also to prevent queue dodging.
- Allows user to change certain preferences of the mod (see commands) and saves these settings to a JSON config file.

note - all stats come from slothpixel not directly from the hypixel API so any downtime of the mod is likely linked to that. If downtime persists I will switch to the hypixel API which has the downside of requiring an api key.
